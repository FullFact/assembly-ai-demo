And we want to hear all your feedback on the questions. And of course, the answers use hashtag. Lgd 2023 The Lagos Group notorial Debates 2023 is also live on News Central on dstv, Channel Four, two, Two, start Times, Channel Two, Seven, four, and can also be heard live on Lagos Talks 90.
1.3 FM.
We've also invited the APC candidates in the person of Governor samolu, but for his best known to him, he's avoiding debates. So he'll be absent at today's debates. But yes, I'm sure you're aware of that already. And we do appreciate those who have made it their mandate to be available for questions at this time. So we'll hand you over.
To your moderators, kundle lawal and Antolecki, they'll take over from here.

Good evening, Candidates. And welcome to the Lagos gubernatorial Debates. You've emerged from your parties. And now you're on the ballot.
This debates would consist of ten questions with a time limit of 1 minute and 30 seconds per candidates. And the questions, of course, will be taken randomly from Economy, Security, Health, et. Cetera. It will be interesting to add at this point that the Nigerian Fact checkers Coalition would also be checking most of the.
Facts you'll be given while debating. We'll go back once we receive messages from them and correct that the purpose of this debate is that Lagos will.
The rules are as follows. Any rude retorts or comments is not acceptable. The purpose of this debate is not to attack anyone, but to give a full frontal position to solving the issues. And again, the only objective of this debate is that Lagos must win. Audience members are not allowed to ask questions and should hold applause until.
Every candidate has spoken. And now, for the first question.
Going ahead to the first question in a democracy, which of course, is being practiced in Nigeria. And of course, the sob entity Lagos State parties are voted in, and it will be an icebreaker to the people of Lagos State to let the people know what your parties represent based on its Constitution.
And what Legotians are to expect from your party while your party is in government. Now we are going to follow an alphabetical order to answering it and we'll turn it the way other way around for the second question. So alphabetically we have to start with the candidate of the adc. Thank you.
Thank you very much. Good evening. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. And thank you.
For the organizers of this friends, this debate.
For an opportunity to address the people of Lagos.
So our party.
Which is the adc, the African Democratic Congress.
Essentially stands for Good governance.
It stands for People Oriented government.
Government.
That drives.
A prosperous and productive society where the resources of the society.
Are shared broadly.
Across.
The society.
A lot of what our underlying manifesto represents is reflected in our agenda for Lagos, which we call the Tiger Agenda. And if you look at that agenda, you will see that it talks about tax reform for equity, talks about infrastructure, it talks about government reform.
Education and health systems that the people trust and rule of law. These are all things that seek to establish a broadly prosperous society where the wealth is spread across and not just concentrated in a few which.
Has been essentially the anticipates of Lagos over the last 25 years.
Thank you very much.
Alphabetically. Of course, the next party is the labor party.
Okay.
So thank you so much for having me and thank you for this opportunity again, to be able to address the good people of Legos.
Labor Party is an institution that.
Is focused mainly on workers rights, on restoring dignity to Labor.
On Social Welfare, Social Justice.
The idea that you can have broad based growth with a real emphasis on productivity.
Is really a productivity about ensuring that there's a social welfare system, a social welfare net to be able to ensure that everybody is carried along in the development of estates or the constraints of the country.
It's also about ensuring that the workers rights are protected, both formal and informal workers are carrying along. And that's what our manifesto is also saying.
Also, one of the major pushes in the Labor Party is about moving from consumption to production.
Having productive economy.
That's where I'll put the blind there for Labor Party. Thank you. Thank you very much.
Next candidate of course will be of the nrm. Thank you.
Thank you.
I don't know. It's my mic on okay. Good evening, everyone. Thank you for having me here.
The National Rescue Movement as the name connotes.
Is really about people the rescue.
Of society.
And the objective and values stem around the understanding that power is given for the purpose of serving God and man.
And our interest really is the goal is to deliver happiness.
We want to deliver happiness.
To society. And we intend to do that through the Avenue and the agency.
Of what we describe as the Easy Agenda, which stands for employment enterprises, social services, and infrastructure. So easy.
Our view is that you cannot have a modern society where people are left behind and our intention is to ensure that the welfare of the people is paramount and everything that is done is done to deliver.
To everybody every member of the society.
And that's our aim. That's our goal. Thank you very much. Next will be the candidates of the People's Democratic Party. Thank you.
All right. Thank you very much.
So, the People's Democratic party.
It's a national party.
That actually recognizes the fact that par belongs to the people. If you see that in appeal.
And it's one party that has proven.
A track record of success in the history of this country.
By.
The moving power, especially in the business community today.
If we join the privileges in the telecommunication industry you know what used to be.
It is our party that brought about this by opening up the economy for organized private sector to play. And you would have seen in the man flying our national flag.
It goes about preaching.
Economic recovery and also preaching devolution of power. So which means this party believes in the people and the belief power is to the people. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Next will be the candidate of the Social Democratic party.
Thank you very much for inviting me. I believe the package is not going to be very relevant in this election. The ruling party we don't have where we don't have money.
We are kidnapped. We are insecure. So people will now want to get for themselves a good life. So I would like to repeat.
The question again, the question is about your party, not about any other party.
I'm a lawyer, right? So just let me do what I know how to do best.
So for us in the Social Democratic part.
Our intention. And the purpose is to write all these abnormalities that have rendered us some human. And we will remember that.
Moshe kashima will be online. We're so father of this party. And we all know as a fact that we won the election day. It's still the same party. We are the hope of the people of this country. And our intention is to come in there and make sure that.
We fulfill Jeremy baker's definition of good governance, which is the greatest happiness of the greatest number.
We give you health. We give you better medical care. We'll do the roads. We'll secure your lives. And we ensure that you can move from point A to point B at any point in time. This is the slogan of the Party. This is the purpose of our party. And we can assure you that we intend to deliver at this election. Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Our next question.
So when a candidate decides to run for governor, he or she must select a deputy governor. We often forget the importance of this deputy governor and who will replace the governor. In any case of unforeseen circumstances, deputies are thought to be selected just to fulfill gender or religious balance, where they should be a representation of the Bonat.
Bonatorial candidate's mindsets and selection standards for his cabinets and a direction in which his government will go. We would like the candidates to explain to the viewers the criteria used in selecting your Deputy Governor. And we'll be starting with the scp candidates. Thank you.
Thank you very much for the question.
Thank you very much.
Letting the deputy Governor of the Socio Democratic Party Number One. Me, I'm a Muslim.
And I'm a man, which is very obvious. So.
We needed to balance it all by looking for a suitable Lady.
To compliment him and necessarily a Christian. And the deputy governor of the Social Democratic Party is a Christian who had been a member of the redeemed Church of Christ for more than 25 years. So we have it balanced there. We are not in this other mentality of Muslim. This is.
Number one, Number two.
She's also anonymobile.
She's the wife of the King of the oba of ek. And the reason for that is we want to believe that we require some kind of.
Balancing.
We are an academician. I'm a bureaucrat. She's a traditional person, so we can complement it. And this was the basis for choosing our candidates. And we can assure you that in my absence, she's celebr.
She's going to school. She's a retired teacher and she's people friendly. She will compliment me when I'm there, even when I'm government. She has a very important role to play in the socio Democratic Party governance in lego State. She's the wife of the King of eque. Although the King says.
Although you're back, we have issues there which I don't want to discuss. Thank you very much.
Next is the PDP candidate. Thank you. All right. Thank you very much.
Sure everybody would have seen in the nomination of my deputy eradicate departure from the stereotype norm.
When popular governors in Nigeria today, nobody knows their deputy. But for us, we've been able to break that by ensuring that my deputy.
Opposed to Be on Sunday. Not just that she's a successful entrepreneur.
And she's done well.
In a chosen career. She read law, but she found passion in filmmaking. In this economy that we are trying to run. She's somebody who has invested a whole lot in this economy.
Somebody who has been an employer of Labor.
Even opportunity to young legacians just like myself. So in being that aside the fact that we're a party that is very sensitive to gender. I'm sure you have seen that.
Punjabi is my deputy. She read law. The University of Lagos.
And we believe that a deputy governor should be as good as the governor. So what is it that we are coming to do? We are coming to run an economy of Lagos. We are coming to ensure that that wealth of legos work for the people of legos. And what we need is a good manager with.
A track record of success. And that is one of the reasons why I've chosen my deputy. Thank you.
Thank you. The next candidate from nim. Thank you. Yes.
I described myself as a nation builder and somebody who understands that.
The Nigerian political system is broken.
And in choosing a deputy was very, very important and crucial that we were looking for someone who was not a traditional politician, somebody who could Subscribe.
To the philosophy of societism.
Which really we believe that.
We must look after.
The whole range of our society.
And so.
We picked Mrs. Azizat dabiri adeli, who is an educationist and somebody who definitely is working with young minds and to really help us turn.
This society around.
She is an administrator. And to that extent.
We will work together as a fine team.
I am someone who in the various activities that I've done, I know how to.
Pick professionals who are highly motivated and who are able to be team players, who can work and encourage and inspire others. So you will see this once we have the opportunity to lead the administration of this state. Thank you.
Thank you. The next candidate from LP.

So my choice. And the process by which I came to it was.
One for me philosophical point of view where I believe that since colonization Nigeria sort of lost his identity.
It's placement of the Traditional Council and traditional.
Type of government. That.
Was placed before we were colonized. And it sort of has given us this identity crisis, situation.
An institution where the uptake of policy is not something that is very easily achievable. And so that's one. And I feel that it's extremely important that government now, as opposed to just inheriting.
The position.
Restores dignity to traditional ruling houses. So that was one factor. Also this other factor about gender balance, which is extremely important to me. And also having somebody that's highly cerebral has political experience.
The choice for my deputy.


So the choice of my deputy was Princess Islamia.
Abiodun Oye fusi she is the daughter of lit? Ayobury of Ikurdu. She also has she's a graduate of law.
She has an mba and she also has a degree in management studies. And another thing that's extremely important to me is she has experience in local governments, local governance, especially in England, where she worked in the boroughs and local government structures there. So there's lots of wealth of experience that she's going to bring to the.
Table. She's also a central candidates for Lagos East in 2019 election during which she did remarkably well, remarkably well. So that was my choice for Deputy Government. Thank you.
Thank you. To the next candidate, please. Thank you.
Our Deputy Governor candidate is barrister.
Mrs. Rosemary Giwamo and her choice reflects two things.
First is merit.
And second, is diversity. And that reflects an underlying philosophy that says that both of those things are important and you don't have to sacrifice either to get the other.
She's well accomplished.
She has served.
The state.
In the State judiciary.
She has a master's in law and has actually served as a Magistrate within the State judiciary.
And has.
Served. She's also served our party.
The adc in different capacities, and indeed.
Until recently.
Was the state deputy chairman, even though she's having to balance that role with the deputy governorship.
Nomination as we speak.
She's also somebody who has spent a lot of time looking at social justice issues. So she works with the Justice Development and Peace Commission of the Catholic Church and has been very active in that over the years. And this is a body that looks at things like social Justice.
Representation for people who cannot afford representation.
So essentially, championing the cause of the downtrodden. I think it's important that.
As a philosophy, I think that if you have a diverse group, you make much better decisions. And I think she brings a great diversity to our team. And I think collectively, working together, the people of Lagos will be very well represented and will represent a broad spectrum of the interests of the people of Lagos.
Thank you very much. Thank you very much. So the second question, of course.
We'll start again from this side going backwards. That's with the candidate of the ADC.
Your second question goes to US. Section 42 of the Nigerian Constitution guarantees the right to freedom from discrimination on any basis.
Be it gender, ethnicity, expression, religion or political opinion. How would you guarantee these rights in Lagos.
Taking note of the situation in private schools where no one is brought to book for mismanagement of children's lives, police harassment based on undue profiling and manslaughter by agents of the law.
Also with consideration to gender disparities in levels of governance.
It is csa. Okay, thank you.
There are a number of different dimensions in what you've said. I think the first thing is to have a philosophy and a stance of government that says that human rights are to.
Be revert and are to be defended.
Wherever they need to be.
Many of the things that you've talked about.
Are actually.
Criminal right. So it's not as if we need laws against them. It's just a situation where we need to enforce the laws that exist. And as a government.
It would be a central theme of us to ensure that those laws are enforced.
We think that even though, as a policy the State has taken the view that.
We need to enable a proliferation of private schools to meet the shortfall in schools. We think that that is not inconsistent. In other words, you can at the same time still have a monitoring system that ensures that.
Minimum standards are maintained.
There should also be.
A reporting mechanism.
And an Ombudsman unit within the Government framework to ensure that.
Whistleblowing those kinds of reports are taken up very quickly.
And are pursued to their logical conclusion.
I think for us.
As a government. If you recall where I started from saying that.
We essentially.
Want quality of life.
To improve across the spectrum, across the socioeconomic spectrum. And it's important in doing that. And one of the effects of accomplishing that is that people's rights, which the poor are the most downtrodden as you improve their prospects, as you improve their prosperity, their productivity, their livelihoods.
You also deal with many of.
Those deprivations.
That curtail. Thank you very much, sir. Your time is up. The candidates of the Labor Party. Thank you.
So Social Justice.
Is extremely important for us as one of the pillars on which we're going to build the new Lagos.
And Social Justice for US is also about restoring the value for the Legotian life, right. And this comes with monitoring. It comes with consequences. And it comes with enforcement. And this goes even to hospitals where you can bring a person and then.
They just watch this person die in the reception or they don't Act.
Effectively.
Because there are no consequences.
To medical negligence. Right. So.
We're going to instill feedback loops in all of.
These agencies.
Across.
The state. Sorry. I mean sectors, not agencies.
To create feedback is where we gather data and monitor.
These product delivery and service delivery. Sorry, and also enforce.
A relation to negligence. So from hospitals to schools, to any facets of public service.
We are also going to make the DPP.
Directorate of Public Prosecution Robust and.
There'll be commissions under it. There will be hotlines places that you can call to report police brutality.
And any incidents like this for medical negligence, police brutality and any issue that challenges social justice. So we have rapid response from government that will see it all the way through. The idea is by the time we're done in four years, when people know that.
Illegotion has come to get service. They will treat that person with dignity and respect because if they don't there will be consequences.
To it. Thank you. Thank you very much. The candidates of the National Rescue movement.
Okay.
I did say earlier that our system is broken.
And to a large extent.
The politics is broken. Whatever you're experiencing in governance is what happens right from the political layer.
And to my mind, we as a society, have lost our ethical direction.
And our moral compass. And you can see it. Seeping through these things that you have mentioned the laws are there.
There's no law that you're looking for in terms of dealing with these issues that are not there. So as a government, we will be coming in to set an ethical.
Direction to say look, listen as a people.
We need to reinspire and reorientate ourselves so that we know that if we carry on the way we're going, we are going to destroy ourselves to the extent that things happen in a school and somebody looks the other way.
Or the thing is gone to court. And then the judge looks the other way.
These are things that are haunting our society.
And I think we all owe it a duty to ourselves and to almighty God, to really say, let's turn around. We have to turn this society around because where we're going, we're heading for the precipice. So at the end of the day, it's going to be this ethical dimension. We need an ethical change and then.
We will enforce through that ethical direction. We will enforce everything that.
Is meant to be enforced. And I think if the leader, if the administration sets the tone.
Everybody is going to follow if we talk to our judges and we let them know that, look, listen, we want you to do your job, whatever it is that is preventing you from doing your job. We will enable you to do it and to do that job in such a way that we can all be proud of.
I think we will start seeing a turnaround. Thank you very much, the candidates of the PDP. So for us.
We're running.
A government that is going to ensure that the rights of the vulnerables in the society.
Is looked at all. We're going to ensure that we protect them. So for that reason, in our own manifesto, we are creating two ministries to what we have now.
Ministry for Children Affairs and People with Disability people with Disability in the sense that we now have to ensure.
The field part of this particular society. And as the Governor of Legal state, I'm not going to give approval to any building that refuses to accommodate access.
For the people with Disability and.
They're also going to be part of this for Children Affairs, but also because we have to give them special attention to make sure that.
We have.
Their government taking a very good care of them from the crate, with their health, their education and the like. Everywhere I go to my campaign, especially the grassroots, I usually say this to them. It's part of everything I see every time I say to them that, look, don't tell me I'm the one that pays my wife down because of that. You hit your wife or you beat your wife as governor.
Of legos. You have me to contend with. So that is already out there because I preach it in the language I understand. So that's one other thing that we're doing, we talk about police brutality. Yes, of course. There are things that we might feel we don't have control over. What about the one we can quickly do to ensure.
A replica of such an opportunities. Let me use Poland rahim incidents. Of course. Balani raheem was short and it was taken to three hospitals in nature, and she was rejected. Industrial hospitals. What I would have done differently as Governor of legos did, is to sanction that three hospitals for the jetting Bonali body boneless, gunshot wound. And I'll be using.
That to send a message to other or speeches across the state should only in case we have a replica of such an opportunity. Then they will know they have to take it back because there's a law which says you must treat a gunshot person.
Thank you. The candidates of the Social Democratic Party. Thank you very much.
You know, the Constitution we have is not a people's Constitution. It's just a document that is drafted the way a manner that is drafted.
As it is there those rights that you have.
Tables that are more observed in the aberration that in compliance. And I tell you for free, we go to schools. Me. I'm an example of a good product of a public school system.
I attended with Palm School in a Korea public school. I take my father paid nothing. I tell them this boy says my father paid close to nothing. Frederick School of Arts in Science. Absolutely nothing. And I ended up investing.
We had nothing but I found myself sending my son to schools where I pay 1.51.3 million.
App a time so it's an abnormal situation. The public school system in this state has totally collapsed. I went to my primary school.
About six months ago, there were no teachers there. There were even no students. So what we need to do now is to recalibrate the minds of the Nigerians and to ensure that we do what is right. We need to establish colleagues of education where you have teachers that will go to this course. We need to bring in the scholarship schem.
Scheme. Whereby.
People can.
Actually have their children in school at very minimal cost.
Our public hospitals. How many government hospitals exist in this state, for example? Now we can say, is funded by government. There are very few. So all the problems we are having is because the government has abandoned the healthcare system to the private sector. And the primary responsibility deserves the private sector is to make money. Nigerian police.
Thank you very much.
Out of time.
Thank you. The next question.
In legal States, sea level rise has resulted in significant ocean churches and an increase in the intensity of flooding episodes across major cities in the States, making it one of Nigeria's most vulnerable States to the effects of flooding. How do you plan to tackle the issue of flooding in the States? We'll start with the sdb candidate. Thank you.
Floyd in lego State. You know this acquired Late City. They built them the one very close to this place.
The impact assessment shows that it was a wrong decision.
For some money backs to create a city for themselves in that city. Now what they did now is they have all tied Nation dead. They have altered this drive from what do you call for Victoria Land down to equate. So you see flooding with the flooding they did not experience before that city was put in place is what we now have. So.
The entire Victorian airline can go down because of the problem of.
This alternation of the alteration of the ocean bed. So what we need to do is to again look at the problems that have been created. The legal state government Physical Planning Division, they have awarded land to people and they are built on canals. That's what is going on in lakey and other places. So there is no water flow.
The gutters have blocked. So what we are going to do, we are going to realize the Ministry of Physical Planning. We're also going to.
Work with relevant institutes. We're not going to create anything. We're not going to bring in any new laws. What we will do is we'll work with what we have now and ensure that the water moves because.
It's a regular everywhere. And I can assure you after one year of our administration, Dove telling you to the second year, we are going to have a better taxi, but we are going to the appraise. This is quite like.
Problem that we are having in Lagos Island. Thank you very much. Thank you, sir. And now for the PDP candidates. All right. Thank you very much.
I think we all know that Lagos is one of the sinking cities in the world because of popularity and the spirit of our kids.
I think that's an error time will be added for that.
Okay.
I think.
I'll take team should start the counter again so it could start. Okay. So like I was saying so Lagos is one of the same cases if it was so we already know our peculiarities. But you see, resolving our problem should be a proper planning and preparation to it because we don't have any solution to it. Unfortunately.
This government 24 years ago, inherited just six major water collectors in Lagos. Rudoyanaru shomolupa.
To unilag and Abu Dhasur Lady and by.
Now we are 1.2 kilometer, but it's not done. But now we should be talking about at least.
20 water collectors in Lagos and preparing for the release is like.
The moment I'm announced the winner of the election in March.
I will use his last hundred days in office to start my own work because I'm resuming in May. So what would be that? I will engage all, of course, I'm really big. I will engage all anybody that wants government patronage in environmental, sanitation and volunteers to say, you know what? We can start assisting now by disrupting all our water collectors as volun.
Volunteers are painting where we come into office and we embark on rigorously. So solution to this is preparing for it. Just like in winter. Everybody knows winter is coming. You need to change whatever you need to change and prepare for that because we don't have solution today because of the pecolity of our state. Now, if we then begin to now embark on.
Aggressive construction of additional.
Protocols in the State of legos because we know the state of our state number two, if you go.
Thank you. Your time is up.
Now for the candidate of the National.
Now for the kind of the National Rescue movement.
Bell. And the last Bell. Thank you. Okay. Thank you.
National rescue.
Thank you.
Part of the problems that we have.
Also man made. And this comes back to this issue that somebody said if we don't kill corruption, corruption will kill us.
And we are facing the edge of the precipice at the rate in which we're going, you have town planning authorities that are not doing their job. That as far as they're concerned. Once they get some real good payoff.
Then anything goes.
You have as was alluded to people are building where they shouldn't build roads have to even veer away from the original plants from the master plan.
So we are in a mess and it is going to.
Take an ethical government to come in and really bring in some consultants that are going to look at this thing.
Very, very objectively and tell us, how are we going to build these drainages? Because you have a city that's already built. How are you going to get drainages sorted out the best way, the quickest way.
In addition to all of that.
You have the on hygienic conditions of people throwing waste anywhere. So things are really building up. And unless we really do take some urgent steps, we are going to be.
In very, very serious problems. You have.
People pouring sand, building Islands where they shouldn't build. Suddenly you look up and an island has surfaced that they say it belongs to an individual. So we've got to really take care and look at ourselves. Thank you. Time is up, sir. Thank you. And now for the Labor Party candidate.
So, as an architect, I'm uniquely positioned to be able to solve this problem.
For me. It starts with.
The disrespect.
Or the lack of implementation of a proper wetland protection policy.
The wetlands are nietzsche's natural reservoirs, especially in a coastal city. And even though some people might say legos is thinking, you look at most of the nordic countries. A lot of them are below sea level, but with the way they've managed their water systems, they are thriving just fine.
So forth, we're going to have the West Side Protection policy.
That is circumstance to development.
And ensure that.
This is part of the Urban Planning for legos in general.
Right.
Thank you.
Yes. So we have a wetland protection policy that allows that to be sacrificed to urban planning. We also make sure that we dredge our waterways and map out our waterbed. So that when we give people contracts to dredge sand from our waterways.
It's done. It's data driven and it's towards our longer objective, our long term objective of actually creating waterways for water transportation. We also make sure that we turn legal state to a fully functioning zero waste state in terms of waste management. So.
We redefined in the minds of our people. The idea of waste is not something you just throw away in doing that.
Thank you. And now for the African Democratic Congress candidates.
Thank you.
So.
I also have the view that this issue has to do with planning.
I think that.
Again where coastal city. We know that there's global warming. So we need to be planning for the effects of this over time and over long term.
One of the things that we do is to in defining infrastructure for a megacity. One of the elements of the infrastructure is the environmental infrastructure. And that has to do with understanding how the environment will affect the city and what channels. And so on. You need to have in place to deal with that. And we need to have a roadmap.
For this component of our infrastructure.
And an understanding of what it will take us to fund it on an annual basis to deal with the issue involved. I agree with the wetlands policy.
I think the other point that I would make has to do with our government reform agenda.
Part of the issue here is not that people.
Do not all the time know what to do, but often decisions are taken by people who have the responsibility within government.
Not based on the interests of the people. So where planning permissions are given to block.
Canals, or to block the natural drainages.
A lot of the time this is done based on inducements. This is done based on extortion and those kinds of things. And we are saying that as a general principle, we are coming in to ensure that.
Civil servants, public workers are well compensated. And once we pay them well, we will then insist. Thank you, sir. Your time is up. Thank you. Thank you, everyone.
Thank you to the candidates. You've been timely with questions. I must commend the quality of candidates. Lagos has available.
I must also commend the audience.
For keeping the house in order.
Your third question.
And we of course will be starting with the candidate of the adc local Government autonomy rides on the back of a restructuring model clamored for generally in the political landscape.
Fact allocation to local Governments in Lagos.
And nothing below 300 million Naira per month. Even though this is divided by lcds, we must place into context the high IGR.
That's the internal generated revenue of these lcdas, or lgs local governments are the first handshake of democracy to the people.
How will you in office be ensuring the free hand of the third tier of governance to enable and ensure.
All round sector development in Legal State thank you.
Thank you.
So the first thing again philosophically. We believe in decentralization. We believe that.
Government should be close to the people and that those that are close to the people should have the resources to do the work because they understand the needs of the people. That doesn't mean that the state should turn a blind eye or should.
Be have no cognizance of what is going on. But if the people who are closest to the people have the resources to deal with the issues that the people face, I think will be in a better position.
One of the historical issues that we have had.
Is that.
We have not always had the capacity within the local government.
Governments to deliver that quality of governance.
And as a result.
Or maybe as a direct part of that, resources are tended to be controlled at the center of the state. And you know that the local government elections are handled by state agencies, not by INEC. So a lot of the time what we've had is a situation where people at the center have essentially chosen people.
Who chosen people at the local government for reasons other than capacity, for reasons other than merit on the basis of things like loyalty and so on.
We believe that commensurate and at the same time that we are devolving resources to the local governments.
We are also ensuring that.
The merit is the criterion for people rising to positions of authority within the local government. And we will have no other criteria other than merits. We're not interested in people who are loyal to us. We are interested in people who will do the work for the people. Thank you very much, sir. The candidates of the Labor Party. Thank you. I have to go on record to say that.
It is Grace that the assembly of Legal State has consistently turned down the Local Government Autonomy bill. It's very unfortunate for our government, the local government to form the foundation on which our government should rest, because all our policies will be coming from a robust local government.
Structure.
We'll also be giving them back responsibilities in terms of revenue generating, such as advert.
Advertorial responsibilities and benefits in terms of revenue generation that has been usurped by the state.
All our programs whether it be employability skills that want to give our youth.
Waste management, waste wealth processes. Everything will be domiciled at the local government because we believe that would allow for a very solid uptake for these our policies. We also feel that having potential governors as local government chairman will be visionary leaders will.
Be able to actually turn local governments around. And that has been lacking. Like Mr. Dorty said, you have situation where they are rewarding political lackeys with local government positions. That will not be the case with us. We want high performance, high thinking visionaries as local government chairman and they will champion.
Development at our local governments, which will make my work a lot easier. Thank you. Thank you very much. The candidates of the National Rescue movement.
We often vilify the.
99 Constitution.
But there are parts of that Constitution that really.
We need to hold very, very tight. One of which is it's enshrined in the Constitution. The local government rules, the rules of local government, which.
Are really basic education, adult education, vocational training the marketplaces.
The advertorials.
Roads.
All the very, very important things that affect you and me are within the purview of the local government. So we as a people need to let the guys that are stopping us from really, really getting our local governments doing what they should. We as the people need to rise up and understand our rights. If people.
Don't really care about their rights. If you don't know who your local government chairman is, if you don't know who your counselor is, they're going to get away with Blue Murder. You mentioned 300 million, and that's an amazing number, which means that the local government is getting this money in and they're not deploying it to what they should be. You are having potholes in the road. You're having classrooms.
Crumbling.
You don't have things in the classroom. You don't have basic health. And these are all responsibilities of our local governments. So I hope that if you take nothing away today, that you at least take this issue. And tomorrow we all should go and start asking our local government. What have they been doing with their money? Thank you.
Thank you very much. The candidates of the People's Democratic Party. All right. Thank you very much. I think quickly.
When you mentioned fact the other time at the state level it is what they call Jack, which is joint account, just allocation account between the state and the local government level. So the $300 million you mentioned is what they are given.
From that Jack, because the money paid in a joint account, which they've created.
Now and with that.
You see if you want to decentralize development just like what we have now. Everybody's committed center if local government works, you see people stay where they are to do their business and to do whatever it is they want to do. But what to do.
Given that name autonomy even if.
You don't even want to let go the Jack of a thing, because for me as a governor of the state I would look at because I have a privilege to go everywhere. And I've seen that local government rules are in terrible shape if they get 300 million shared among three local government lcda, two and one local government.
Six. So in this case there's nothing happening after payment of salary, everything at the center taxes that is supposed to be connecting is already ammonized in the name of harmonization. So all of the things has to return back to that grassroots so that we can make the state work. So some of the things that I would do as governor of Legacy as local government chairman, if your road is not fit, I will fix it for you and.
I'll detox the money the same way with Federal Road. And as for the phone thereafter by so doing.
We'll quickly wrap up developments in a state so.
I'm of autonomy. And it has to be real. Even if you want to do. Jack, you must provide leadership. Leadership is the missing link here. Thank you very much.
The candidates, the candidates of the Social Democratic Party. First and foremost, you have been speaking about local government in legos State. We have not just local government.
